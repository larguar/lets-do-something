# Let's Do Something

What do you gift someone who only ever wants 'experiences', or when 'your time' is the only gift they need? For my step dad's Christmas gift, I curated a JSON list of fun things to do around the area and put together an aesthetic, informational website to display them. Featuring an image, brief description, a few notes from me, and a link to learn more, each location is an exciting preview of some fun things we could do together. Any time he wants to do something, he can just open up the site for ideas, pick an activity, and then we coordinate. Easy peasy.
